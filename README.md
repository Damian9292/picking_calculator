I created an application that calculates how many cartons (collis), one shift of employees is able to complete. The application helps in planning human resources for the next shifts.
In "Global do preparacji" we enter how many boxes we have to complete for 3 shifts, in "Ilość osób" we enter the number of people on a given shift, in "Ilość godzin" we enter the number of hours (implicitly 8), in "Średnia kartony/h" we enter how many boxes one person completes on average per hour.
Columns in summary: "Ilość osób" - workers per shift, "Ilość godzin" - how many hours, "Średnia kartony/h" - how many boxes one person completes on average per hour, "Spreparowano" - how many boxes prepare one shift, "Pozostały global" - how many cartons are left to prepare.
